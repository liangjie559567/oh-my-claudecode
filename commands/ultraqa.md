[ULTRAQA ACTIVATED - AUTONOMOUS QA CYCLING]

$ARGUMENTS

## ULTRAQA MODE

You are now in **ULTRAQA** mode - an autonomous QA cycling workflow that runs until your quality goal is met.

**Cycle**: qa-tester → oracle verification → fix → repeat

## GOAL PARSING

Parse the goal from arguments. Supported formats:

| Invocation | Goal Type | What to Check |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| `/ultraqa --tests` | tests | All test suites pass |
| `/ultraqa --build` | build | Build succeeds with exit 0 |
| `/ultraqa --lint` | lint | No lint errors |
| `/ultraqa --typecheck` | typecheck | No TypeScript errors |
| `/ultraqa --custom "pattern"` | custom | Custom success pattern in output |

If no structured goal provided, interpret the argument as a custom goal.

## CYCLE WORKFLOW

### Cycle N (Max 5)

1. **RUN QA**: Execute verification based on goal type
   - `--tests`: Run `npm test` or equivalent
   - `--build`: Run `npm run build` or equivalent
   - `--lint`: Run `npm run lint` or equivalent
   - `--typecheck`: Run `npm run typecheck` or `tsc --noEmit`
   - `--custom`: Run appropriate command and check for pattern

2. **CHECK RESULT**: Did the goal pass?
   - **YES** → Exit with success message
   - **NO** → Continue to step 3

3. **ORACLE DIAGNOSIS**: Spawn oracle to analyze failure
   ```
   Task(subagent_type="oh-my-claude-sisyphus:oracle", prompt="DIAGNOSE FAILURE:
   Goal: [goal type]
   Output: [test/build output]
   Provide root cause and specific fix recommendations.")
   ```

4. **FIX ISSUES**: Apply oracle's recommendations
   - Use sisyphus-junior for code changes
   - Be specific and targeted

5. **REPEAT**: Go back to step 1

## EXIT CONDITIONS

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Goal Met** | Exit with success: "ULTRAQA COMPLETE: Goal met after N cycles" |
| **Cycle 5 Reached** | Exit with diagnosis: "ULTRAQA STOPPED: Max cycles. Diagnosis: ..." |
| **Same Failure 3x** | Exit early: "ULTRAQA STOPPED: Same failure detected 3 times. Root cause: ..." |
| **Environment Error** | Exit: "ULTRAQA ERROR: [tmux/port/dependency issue]" |

## OBSERVABILITY

Output progress each cycle:
```
[ULTRAQA Cycle 1/5] Running tests...
[ULTRAQA Cycle 1/5] FAILED - 3 tests failing
[ULTRAQA Cycle 1/5] Oracle diagnosing...
[ULTRAQA Cycle 1/5] Fixing: auth.test.ts - missing mock
[ULTRAQA Cycle 2/5] Running tests...
[ULTRAQA Cycle 2/5] PASSED - All 47 tests pass
[ULTRAQA COMPLETE] Goal met after 2 cycles
```

## STATE TRACKING

Track state in `.sisyphus/ultraqa-state.json`:
```json
{
  "active": true,
  "goal_type": "tests",
  "goal_pattern": null,
  "cycle": 1,
  "max_cycles": 5,
  "failures": ["3 tests failing: auth.test.ts"],
  "started_at": "2024-01-18T12:00:00Z",
  "session_id": "uuid"
}
```

## CANCELLATION

User can cancel with `/cancel-ultraqa` which clears the state file.

## IMPORTANT RULES

1. **PARALLEL when possible** - Run diagnosis while preparing potential fixes
2. **TRACK failures** - Record each failure to detect patterns
3. **EARLY EXIT on pattern** - 3x same failure = stop and surface
4. **CLEAR OUTPUT** - User should always know current cycle and status
5. **CLEAN UP** - Clear state file on completion or cancellation

Begin ULTRAQA cycling now. Parse the goal and start cycle 1.
